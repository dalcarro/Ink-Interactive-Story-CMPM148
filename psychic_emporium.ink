+[Observation] you look over at the list. To further investigate it, you ask the fortune teller for a cup of water. When she leaves, you see that the list consists of names of couples (ex. jane doe & john doe) and several of them have been crossed out.


+[Conversation] Fortune teller asks how she can help you. When she comes back, you mention how her business seems to be booming. She says that with the recent abductions, sheâ€™s been helping parents by seeing if she could sense their spirit in the spirit realm or the realm of the living.
